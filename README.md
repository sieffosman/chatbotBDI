## Introduction

This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about a topic. It uses the Flask web framework for the web interface and spaCy for NLP processing. Users can interact with the chatbot by submitting questions, and the chatbot provides responses based on predefined FAQs.

## Features

- Basic chatbot functionality.
- Integration with spaCy for NLP processing.
- Web interface for user interaction.
- Customizable FAQ expansion.
- Styling options for the chatbot widget.
